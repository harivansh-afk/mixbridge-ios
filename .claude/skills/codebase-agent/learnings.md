## Patterns (What Works)

Successful approaches and code patterns that should be reused.

### State Management
- Use `@Observable` macro (Swift 5.9+) for observable classes, not `ObservableObject`
- Pass managers via `.environment(Manager.shared)` in the view hierarchy
- Access in views via `@Environment(ManagerType.self) private var manager`

### SwiftUI View Structure
```swift
struct MyView: View {
    @State private var localState = false
    @Environment(AuthManager.self) private var authManager

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            content
                .navigationTitle("Title")
                .task { await loadData() }
        }
    }
}
```

### Async Data Loading
- Use `.task { }` modifier for initial data loading
- Use `RefreshableScrollView` with async closure for pull-to-refresh
- Background preloading via `Task(priority: .background) { }`

### Audio Playback
- `PlaybackCoordinator.shared` handles all playback
- Use `PlayerState.shared` for UI state (current track, isPlaying, progress)
- Exponential backoff for retries (`RetryMetadata` pattern)

---

## Failures (What to Avoid)

Approaches that failed, bugs encountered, and time-wasting paths.

### AVPlayer Buffering
- NEVER set `automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling = false` - causes random pauses
- Always set `preferredForwardBufferDuration` to prevent micro-stalls (10 seconds used in this codebase)

### Deprecated Patterns
- Don't use `ObservableObject` + `@Published` - use `@Observable` macro instead
- Don't use completion handlers - use async/await

---

## Edge Cases

Tricky scenarios and non-obvious behaviors discovered during development.

### SoundCloud API
- Track duration is in milliseconds - divide by 1000 for seconds
- Artwork URLs use `t500x500` by default - use `String.upgradeArtworkQuality()` for higher resolution
- Stream URLs require OAuth token in Authorization header for direct CDN access

### Queue Management
- Tracks are removed from queue when they start playing (see `handleTrackStartedPlaying`)
- Queue index becomes -1 after track is removed from queue
- Use `QueueManager.indexOfTrack(withId:)` to find current position

---

## Technology Insights

Framework-specific knowledge, library quirks, and API insights.

### Convex Backend
- Three operation types: `query` (read), `mutation` (write), `action` (side effects/external APIs)
- All responses wrapped in `ConvexResponse<T>` with `status` and `value` fields
- Use `forceRefresh: true` parameter to bypass cache

### SwiftUI iOS 18 Features
- `@Observable` macro replaces ObservableObject
- `Tab` view with `.tabViewBottomAccessory` for mini player
- `.navigationTransition(.zoom(sourceID:in:))` for matched transitions
- `.matchedTransitionSource(id:in:)` for transition sources

### AVAudioEngine (Mix Mode)
- Used for crossfade playback via `MixPlaybackEngine`
- Supports configurable crossfade duration, prewarm time, and fade curves
- Falls back to regular AVPlayer on failure

---

## Conventions

Project-specific coding conventions and style guidelines.

### File Organization
- One primary type per file, file named after the type
- Related extensions can be in the same file
- Views organized by feature in `Views/` subdirectories

### Naming
- Types: PascalCase (`PlaybackCoordinator`, `TrackRow`)
- Properties/methods: camelCase (`currentTrack`, `playNext()`)
- Private properties: prefixed with nothing special, just `private`

### SwiftUI Conventions
- Use `@ViewBuilder` for computed properties returning views
- Use `private var` for sub-views extracted from body
- Include both light and dark mode `#Preview` blocks

### Error Handling
- Define typed error enums (e.g., `ConvexError`, `PlayerState.PlaybackError`)
- Implement `LocalizedError` with `errorDescription` for user-facing messages
- Use `async throws` pattern, catch at call site

### Haptic Feedback
```swift
// Light tap (buttons)
HapticManager.light()

// Medium impact (important actions)
HapticManager.medium()

// Selection change (tab switches, list selections)
HapticManager.selection()
```

## Metal / GPU Programming

Insights from implementing Metal shaders and GPU-based effects.

### MTKView Texture Loading Race Condition
- **Context**: When using MTKView with UIViewRepresentable for image morphing
- **Learning**: The first `draw(in:)` call often happens before textures are loaded. If you return early without drawing, uninitialized GPU buffer memory may show (appears as red/garbage colors). Always explicitly clear to transparent when textures aren't ready.
- **Example**:
```swift
guard let fromTexture = fromTexture, let toTexture = toTexture else {
    // DON'T just return - clear to transparent
    renderPassDescriptor.colorAttachments[0].loadAction = .clear
    renderPassDescriptor.colorAttachments[0].clearColor = MTLClearColor(red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0, alpha: 0)
    if let encoder = commandBuffer.makeRenderCommandEncoder(descriptor: renderPassDescriptor) {
        encoder.endEncoding()
    }
    commandBuffer.present(drawable)
    commandBuffer.commit()
    return
}
```

### MTKView Transparency Setup
- **Context**: Making MTKView content properly transparent for layering
- **Learning**: Must set multiple properties: `isOpaque = false`, `backgroundColor = .clear`, `framebufferOnly = false`. The clearColor in render pass must also have alpha = 0.

### Layer Behind GPU Views for Seamless Transitions
- **Context**: SwiftUI conditionally rendering Metal views during animations
- **Learning**: Always layer the "destination" content behind GPU views. When the GPU view is removed (conditional becomes false), the correct content is already visible - prevents flicker.
- **Example**:
```swift
ZStack {
    // Base layer - destination artwork always visible
    PlayerArtworkView(artwork: destinationArtwork)

    // Overlay - Metal morph only during transition
    if isTransitioning {
        MetalMorphView(from: currentArtwork, to: destinationArtwork)
    }
}
```

## SwiftUI State Synchronization

### DisplayedTrack vs PlayerState.currentTrack Race Condition
- **Context**: Carousel UI state (`displayedTrack`) vs actual playback state (`playerState.currentTrack`)
- **Learning**: During crossfade completion, `isCrossfading` becomes false before `displayedTrack` updates via `.onChange`. Using `playerState.currentTrack.artwork` instead of `displayedTrack.artwork` prevents the brief flicker to old artwork.
- **Example**:
```swift
// BAD - uses displayedTrack which may be stale
artwork: track.artwork  // where track = displayedTrack

// GOOD - uses playerState which is already updated
artwork: playerState.crossfadeNextTrack?.artwork ?? playerState.currentTrack.artwork
```

### Progress Bar Interpolation During Crossfade
- **Context**: Audio crossfade where playback position jumps from end of track A to start of track B
- **Learning**: Interpolate both position and duration during crossfade to create smooth progress bar transition. Formula: `displayedPosition = outgoingPosition * (1 - progress) + incomingPosition * progress`

## Metal Shader Tips

### Liquid Morph Effect Pattern
- **Context**: Creating visually appealing image transitions
- **Learning**: FBM (Fractional Brownian Motion) noise-based displacement + crossfade creates a "liquid morph" effect. The displacement amplitude should peak at mid-transition (progress = 0.5), so images appear to transform rather than just dissolve.
- **Session**: Metal artwork crossfade morph implementation (2026-01-01)

### Background Metal View Optimization
- **Context**: Using Metal for blurred background effects
- **Learning**: For heavily blurred backgrounds, consider using SwiftUI opacity crossfade instead of Metal - simpler, more reliable, and the blur hides most detail anyway. Reserve Metal for where the effect is clearly visible.
- **Session**: Metal artwork crossfade morph implementation (2026-01-01)

### Always Add Solid Base Layer in Background ZStacks
- **Context**: Multi-layer blurred backgrounds with crossfade transitions
- **Learning**: When compositing multiple semi-transparent or blurred layers (especially with dark artwork), always add a solid `Color.black.ignoresSafeArea()` as the bottommost layer. Without it, when all layers have low opacity (dark artwork + crossfade), uninitialized GPU memory (red/magenta garbage) bleeds through. This is especially problematic during crossfade where opacity values interpolate through low values.
- **Example**:
```swift
ZStack {
    // CRITICAL: Solid base prevents GPU garbage from showing
    Color.black
        .ignoresSafeArea()

    // Layer 1: Stable background (fades out during crossfade)
    PlayerBackgroundView(artwork: currentArtwork)
        .blur(radius: 60)
        .opacity(isCrossfading ? 1.0 - crossfadeProgress : 1.0)

    // Layer 2: Incoming background (fades in during crossfade)
    if isCrossfading {
        PlayerBackgroundView(artwork: nextArtwork)
            .blur(radius: 60)
            .opacity(crossfadeProgress)
    }
}
```
